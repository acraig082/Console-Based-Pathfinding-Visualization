# Console Based Pathfinding Visualization
The A* or Dijkstra algorithm applied to a 2D grid implemented through a 2D weighted directed graph. A map of characters was created for the visualization of each algorithm's behavior to obstacles/maze. The user can choose to either simulate a random maze, or a 'level' containing 'rooms' that you might see in an oldschool roguelike ASCII game.

Through the ability to tweak algorithms, heuristics, and maps, through user input, this program can give you a good sense of how pathfinding algorithms behave under different circumstances.
