# DijkstraGrid
A* and Dijkstra algorithms applied to a 2D grid through a weighted directed graph. A map of characters was created for
the visualization of each algorithm's behavior to obsticles. Rectangles are randomly generated on the map.

Through the ability to tweak algorithms, heuristics, and maps, this program can give you a good sense of how pathfinding algorithms of
this nature act with different parameters or different circumstances.
